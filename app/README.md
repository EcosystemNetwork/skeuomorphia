### ATM Payer Portal - How to use your Skeuomorphia Account

1. An address is generated for you upon login with web3auth.

2. Copy the address using the Copy icon and deposit funds into this address.

3. When you print your banknote, currency is withdrawn from your Web3Auth wallet and deposited into the newly minted banknote.

4. Print or save the banknote and store somewhere safe until funds are used. Treat these notes as cash-equivalent.

5. When you are ready to spend your banknotes at a supported merchant. Hand over your stablecoin banknote and the merchant will redeem for you.

6. Any change is sent back to your Skeuomorphia Bank Account, ready for use again immediately.
